        Welcome to Juicy Jake’s Vegan Restaurant, a place where music,
        creativity, and plant-based passion come together. <br />
        <br />
        Founded by Jake Kelly, a Brighton-based vegan DJ, our restaurant is more
        than just a dining experience – it’s a celebration of flavour,
        community, and sustainability. Jake has been a fixture of Brighton’s
        vibrant music scene for years, spinning tracks that bring people
        together. His journey into veganism was inspired by his love for
        animals, the planet, and a desire to lead a kinder, more conscious life.
        <br />
        <br />
        Now, he’s combining his culinary passion with his musical roots to
        create a space where everyone can enjoy delicious plant-based food in a
        welcoming, upbeat atmosphere. Every dish on our menu is crafted with
        care, using fresh, locally-sourced ingredients that reflect Jake’s
        commitment to quality and sustainability. <br />
        <br />
        Whether you’re a long-time vegan, just curious, or somewhere in between,
        Jake’s Vegan Restaurant offers something for everyone – from hearty
        classics to bold, innovative dishes. Come for the food, stay for the
        vibe – Jake’s Vegan Restaurant is a place to connect, relax, and enjoy
        the best of Brighton’s plant-based scene. Join us and experience the
        unique blend of flavours and rhythms that Jake Kelly brings to the
        table. <br />
        <br />
        We can’t wait to welcome you!
