        Welcome to Jake’s Vegan Restaurant, a place where music, creativity, and plant-based passion come together. Founded by Jake Kelly, a Brighton-based vegan DJ, our restaurant is more than just a dining experience – it’s a celebration of flavour, community, and sustainability.

        Jake has been a fixture of Brighton’s vibrant music scene for years, spinning tracks that bring people together. His journey into veganism was inspired by his love for animals, the planet, and a desire to lead a kinder, more conscious life. Now, he’s combining his culinary passion with his musical roots to create a space where everyone can enjoy delicious plant-based food in a welcoming, upbeat atmosphere.
        
        Every dish on our menu is crafted with care, using fresh, locally-sourced ingredients that reflect Jake’s commitment to quality and sustainability. Whether you’re a long-time vegan, just curious, or somewhere in between, Jake’s Vegan Restaurant offers something for everyone – from hearty classics to bold, innovative dishes.
        
        Come for the food, stay for the vibe – Jake’s Vegan Restaurant is a place to connect, relax, and enjoy the best of Brighton’s plant-based scene.
        
        Join us and experience the unique blend of flavours and rhythms that Jake Kelly brings to the table. We can’t wait to welcome you!</p>
